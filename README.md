# Multidownload

A simple homebrew app for 3ds which downloads the link you type in it ans saves to the root of your sd card.Use people who have broken cameras and cannot scan qr codes.This program can download all file formats(thats why you can download a 3dsx file also)

-----------------------

Instructions:-

Open the app through the homebrew launcher

Enter a URL(the link should be direct link i.e.,it should end with file format)

Click on right button or the okay button on the touch screen

For eg. If I type http://kartik.net16.net/default.php in the download box it will download default.php and save it at root of your sd card
